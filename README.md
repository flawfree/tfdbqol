#tfdbqol, Quality of Life for TF2 Dodgeball, a (somewhat) dying gamemode.

Combined the two common "tfdb.vpk" and "TFDB_Quality_of_Life_pack.vpk" into a singular file (both with unknown creators), 
available both WITHOUT GAMESOUND ( tfdb-qol-nosound ) And with gamesound ( tfdb-qol )

Uses an edited form of popular "snowball" rocket, aka TFC Like Rockets (https://gamebanana.com/mods/12405), except with no rocket trail, no team colours other than the critical effect, has altered volume for the rocket redirect sound, and a far more pleasent rocket beep, far less likely to rift your eardrums.

Just click releases and download the VPK either with or without gamesound, into \Team Fortress 2\tf\custom

Both QOL packs include the snowball rocket, but you can also just download the snowball rocket alone with tfdb-notrail-snowball. This is not needed if you have any of the QOL packs.

That's all, with love from db nonamer fro /id/-fro/
