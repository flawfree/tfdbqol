# **Snowball rocket replacement for TFDB & a Quality of Life pack for TF2 Dodgeball (TFDB), a (somewhat) dying gamemode.**
Are you tired of the rocket trail blocking your vision? Does your TF2 crash at â‰ˆ200 rocket deflects? This helps both of these issues. Better rocket visibility, nosound editions, editions with better rocket beep, and assistance choosing your own rocket beep can also be found here.
### Supports all -dxlevels. 100, 90, 81, 80 et cetera, also supports casual / sv_pure 1 servers.

The rocket is from an altered version of TFC Like rockets, credited below, and nosound, some custom additions & inspiration from two years old custom vpk's graciously made by [Chodens](https://steamcommunity.com/id/chodens), father of MTX.

# Editions (Downloads)
**[1. tfdb-qol](tfdb-qol.vpk)**
>New rocket trail, all QOL improvements and new beep.

**[2. tfdb-qol-nosound](tfdb-qol-nosound.vpk)**
>Same as above, but with very few gamesounds.

**[3. tfdb-notrail-snowball](tfdb-notrail-snowball.vpk)**
>Only the snowball model, nothing else altered. Stock everything except rocket.

**[4. tfdb-qol-sb](tfdb-qol-sb.vpk) & [5. tfdb-qol-nosound-sb](tfdb-qol-nosound-sb.vpk)**
>Same as tfdb-qol.vpk & tfdb-qol-nosound.vpk, but with **stock beep**, aka the sentry sound, rather than the piano note.

**[6. tfdb-customns](tfdb-customns.vpk)**
>Personally adjusted. Nosound is customized, some game sounds are removed, but round countdown voice and voice commands are kept for a more enjoyable experience. Includes snowball rocket and piano key beep.

All editions support the -dxlevel versions I'm aware of. 100, 90, 81, 80 et cetera, also supports casual / sv_pure 1 servers.

# **Installation**
Click any of the numbered installations above, then click **download** on the right or "view raw". Place this *.vpk* into: **steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom** . If you are missing the folder, create it. Feel free to test different editions to find what suits you / your playstyle best. Remember, changing to a far larger rocket **will** make you miss a lot starting out, but it could be worth it on the long term. 

### **Credits**
>Uses a highly edited form of the previously popular TFC Like Rockets ([GameBanana](https://gamebanana.com/mods/12405)), except with no rocket trail, only critical effect team colors, far less particles to help fps/crashing at high deflects, and an adjusted size. version 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 also use the custom additions from two custom vpk's graciously made by [Chodens](https://steamcommunity.com/id/chodens), mr pimp daddy himself. *tfdb.vpk* and *TFDB_Quality_of_Life_pack.vpk*. For years people have been spreading these vpk's word of mouth using both vpks with redundant files.
