# **TFDBQOL, Quality of Life for TF2 Dodgeball (TFDB), a (somewhat) dying gamemode.**
Are you tired of not seeing anything because of the rocket trail? Does your dodgeball crash at â‰ˆ200 deflects? This solves both of these issues.
## Should support all -dxlevels. 100, 90, 81, 80 et cetera.

>Same as tfdb-qol.vpk & tfdb-qol-nosound.vpk, but with **stock beep**, aka the sentry sound, rather than the piano note.

**[6. tfdb-customns](tfdb-customns.vpk)**
>How I like to play, nosound customized specifically for dodgeball, same as tfdb-qol but with a soundmixer specifically proportionalized for dodgeball. Some sounds game sounds are removed, but round countdown voice and voice commands in game are kept. Uses snowball rocket and piano key beep.

**Do you want to set your own rocket sound when using either of the *-sb* editions? see **[this doc](custombeep.md)****

# **Installation**
Click any of the numbered installations above, then click **download** on the right or "view raw". Place this *.vpk* into: **steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom** . If you are missing the folder, you can just create it. Feel free to test different editions to find what suits you best.

**Longer explanation**
>Uses an edited form of popular "snowball" rocket, aka TFC Like Rockets (https://gamebanana.com/mods/12405), except with no rocket trail, no team colours other than the critical effect. *tfdb-qol* is the most standard option. You get all the benefits from the quality of life packs, a new more pleasant rocket beep or sentry sound, and the new rocket. *tfdb-qol-nosound* is the nosound version of this, where almost all sounds except the rocket beep are removed. Both also exist with the suffix *-sb*, which are the same files just without the pleasant beep. You can download this rocket standalone with the *tfdb-notrail-snowball*, which only contains the rocket particle effect. 

That's all, with love from a dodgeball nonamer
