# **Snowball rocket replacement for TFDB & a Quality of Life pack for TF2 Dodgeball (TFDB), a (somewhat) dying gamemode.**
Are you tired of the rocket trail blocking your vision? Does your TF2 crash at â‰ˆ200 rocket deflects? This helps both of these issues. Better rocket visibility, nosound editions, editions with better rocket beep, and assistance choosing your own rocket beep can also be found here.
### Supports all -dxlevels. 100, 90, 81, 80 et cetera, also supports casual / sv_pure 1 servers.

all with love from a dodgeball nonamer; [fro](https://steamcommunity.com/id/druginduced).

# Editions (Downloads)
**[1. tfdb-qol](tfdb-qol.vpk)**
>New rocket trail, all QOL improvements and new beep.

**[2. tfdb-qol-nosound](tfdb-qol-nosound.vpk)**
>Same as above, but with very few gamesounds.

**[3. tfdb-notrail-snowball](tfdb-notrail-snowball.vpk)**
>Only the snowball model, nothing else altered. Stock everything except rocket.

**[4. tfdb-qol-sb](tfdb-qol-sb.vpk) & [5. tfdb-qol-nosound-sb](tfdb-qol-nosound-sb.vpk)**
>Same as tfdb-qol.vpk & tfdb-qol-nosound.vpk, but with **stock beep**, aka the sentry sound, rather than the piano note.

**[6. tfdb-customns](tfdb-customns.vpk)**
>Personally adjusted. Nosound is customized, some game sounds are removed, but round countdown voice and voice commands are kept for a more enjoyable experience. Includes snowball rocket and piano key beep.

All editions support the -dxlevel versions I'm aware of. 100, 90, 81, 80 et cetera, also supports casual / sv_pure 1 servers.

**(GUIDE) Want to set your own custom beep sound? read **[this](custombeep.md)**. Compatible with *-sb* editions.**

# **Installation**
Click any of the numbered installations above, then click **download** on the right or "view raw". Place this *.vpk* into: **steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom** . If you are missing the folder, create it. Feel free to test different editions to find what suits you / your playstyle best. Remember, changing to a far larger rocket **will** make you miss a lot starting out, but it could be worth it on the long term. 

### **Credits**
>Uses a highly edited form of the previously popular TFC Like Rockets ([GameBanana](https://gamebanana.com/mods/12405)), except with no rocket trail, only critical effect team colors, far less particles to help fps/crashing at high deflects, and an adjusted size. version 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 also use the custom additions from two custom vpk's for dodgeball that have been passed around for ages without any known author. *tfdb.vpk* and *TFDB_Quality_of_Life_pack.vpk*. For years people have been using both vpks with redundant files and with little to no knowledge of the effects it has.

Any suggestions? You can add and message me on [steam](https://steamcommunity.com/id/druginduced), or post an issue on GitHub. I might post further files or content for dodgeball, as I've invested far too many hours into it.
