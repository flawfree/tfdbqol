# **Snowball rocket replacement for TFDB & a Quality of Life for TF2 Dodgeball (TFDB) pack, a (somewhat) dying gamemode.**
Are you tired of the rocket trail blocking your vision? Does your TF2 crash at â‰ˆ200 rocket deflects? This helps both of these issues.
### Should support all -dxlevels. 100, 90, 81, 80 et cetera, also works on casual / sv_pure 1 servers.

# Editions
**[1. tfdb-qol](tfdb-qol.vpk)**
>New rocket trail, all QOL improvements and new beep.

**[2. tfdb-qol-nosound](tfdb-qol-nosound.vpk)**
>Same as above, but with very few gamesounds.

**[3. tfdb-notrail-snowball](tfdb-notrail-snowball.vpk)**
>Only the snowball model, nothing else altered. Stock everything except rocket.

**[4. tfdb-qol-sb](tfdb-qol-sb.vpk) & [5. tfdb-qol-nosound-sb](tfdb-qol-nosound-sb.vpk)**
>Same as tfdb-qol.vpk & tfdb-qol-nosound.vpk, but with **stock beep**, aka the sentry sound, rather than the piano note.

**[6. tfdb-customns](tfdb-customns.vpk)**
>Personally adjusted. Nosound is customized, some game sounds are removed, but round countdown voice and voice commands are kept for a more enjoyable experience. Includes snowball rocket and piano key beep.

**(GUIDE) Do you want to set your own rocket sound when using either of the *-sb* editions? read **[this](custombeep.md)****

# **Installation**
Click any of the numbered installations above, then click **download** on the right or "view raw". Place this *.vpk* into: **steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom** . If you are missing the folder, create it. Feel free to test different editions to find what suits you / your playstyle best. Remember, changing to a far larger rocket **will** make you miss a lot starting out, but it could be worth it on the long term. 

### **Credits**
>Uses a highlyedited form of the formerly popular TFC Like Rockets (https://gamebanana.com/mods/12405), except with no rocket trail, no team colours other than the critical effect, far less particles to help optimize for higher speeds, and an adjusted size. version 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 also use the custom additions from two custom vpk's for dodgeball that have been passed around for ages without any known author. *tfdb.vpk* and *TFDB_Quality_of_Life_pack.vpk*. For years people have been using both vpks with redundant files and with little to no knowledge of the effects it has.

Any suggestions? Feel free to post an issue and I'll have a look. You can also add / message me on Steam. I might post further. Thank you for the persistent downloads and use.
