#tfdbqol, Quality of Life for TF2 Dodgeball, a (somewhat) dying gamemode.

Combined the two common "tfdb.vpk" and "TFDB_Quality_of_Life_pack.vpk" into a singular file (both with unknown creators), 
available both WITHOUT GAMESOUND ( tfdb-qol-nosound ) And with gamesound ( tfdb-qol )

Uses an edited form of popular "snowball" rocket, aka TFC Like Rockets (https://gamebanana.com/mods/12405), except with no rocket trail, no team colours other than the critical effect, has altered volume for the rocket redirect sound, and a far more pleasent rocket beep, far less likely to rift your eardrums.

Just click and download the VPK file of your choosing, either with or without gamesound, and copy into \Team Fortress 2\tf\custom

That's all, with love from db nonamer fro /id/-fro/
