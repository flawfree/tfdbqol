# **TFDBQOL, Quality of Life for TF2 Dodgeball (TFDB), a (somewhat) dying gamemode.**
Are you tired of not seeing anything because of the rocket trail? Does your dodgeball crash at â‰ˆ200 deflects? This solves both of these issues.
## Should support all -dxlevels. 100, 90, 81, 80 et cetera.

# Editions
**[1. tfdb-qol](tfdb-qol.vpk)**
>New rocket trail, all QOL improvements and new beep.

**[2. tfdb-qol-nosound](tfdb-qol-nosound.vpk)**
>Same as above, but with very few gamesounds.

**[3. tfdb-notrail-snowball](tfdb-notrail-snowball.vpk)**
>Only the snowball model, nothing else altered. Stock everything except rocket.

**[4. tfdb-qol-sb](tfdb-qol-sb.vpk) & [5. tfdb-qol-nosound-sb](tfdb-qol-nosound-sb.vpk)**
>Same as tfdb-qol.vpk & tfdb-qol-nosound.vpk, but with **stock beep**, aka the sentry sound, rather than the piano note.

**[6. tfdb-customns](tfdb-customns.vpk)**
>How I like to play, nosound customized specifically for dodgeball, same as tfdb-qol but with a soundmixer specifically proportionalized for dodgeball. Some sounds game sounds are removed, but round countdown voice and voice commands in game are kept. Uses snowball rocket and piano key beep.

**Do you want to set your own rocket sound when using either of the *-sb* editions? see **[this doc](custombeep.md)****

# **Installation**
Click any of the numbered installations above, then click **download** on the right or "view raw". Place this *.vpk* into: **steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom** . If you are missing the folder, you can just create it. Feel free to test different editions to find what suits you best.

## **Credits**
>Uses an edited form of popular "snowball" rocket, aka TFC Like Rockets (https://gamebanana.com/mods/12405), except with no rocket trail, no team colours other than the critical effect. version 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 also use the custom additions from two custom vpk's for dodgeball that have been passed around for ages without any author. *tfdb.vpk* and *TFDB_Quality_of_Life_pack.vpk*. This project came about after having gripes with the snowball model looking through the existing dodgeball vpk's and seeing many redundant files doubling up. I've personally used the piano key beep for years, and have realized 99% of players use the stock beep, and very few people have access to the dodgeball vpk's without good connections inside dodgeball.

Any suggestions? Feel free to post an issue and I'll have a look.

That's all, with love from a dodgeball nonamer
