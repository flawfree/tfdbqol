# **TFDBQOL, Quality of Life for TF2 Dodgeball (TFDB), a (somewhat) dying gamemode.**
Are you tired of not seeing anything because of the rocket trail? Does your dodgeball crash at â‰ˆ200 deflects? This solves both of these issues.

# Editions
**[1. tfdb-qol](tfdb-qol.vpk)**
>New rocket trail, all QOL improvements and new beep.

**[2. tfdb-qol-nosound](tfdb-qol-nosound.vpk)**
>Same as above, but with very few gamesounds.

**[3. tfdb-notrail-snowball](tfdb-notrail-snowball.vpk)**
>Only the snowball model.

**[4. tfdb-qol-sb](tfdb-qol-sb.vpk) & [5. tfdb-qol-nosound-sb](tfdb-qol-nosound-sb.vpk)**
>Same as tfdb-qol.vpk & tfdb-qol-nosound.vpk, but with **stock beep**, aka the sentry sound.

# **Installation**
Click any of the numbered installations above, then click **download** on the right or "view raw". Place this *.vpk* into: **steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom** . If you are missing the folder, you can just create it. 

**Longer explanation**
>Uses an edited form of popular "snowball" rocket, aka TFC Like Rockets (https://gamebanana.com/mods/12405), except with no rocket trail, no team colours other than the critical effect. *tfdb-qol* is the most standard option. You get all the benefits from the quality of life packs, a new more pleasant rocket beep or sentry sound, and the new rocket. *tfdb-qol-nosound* is the nosound version of this, where almost all sounds except the rocket beep are removed. Both also exist with the suffix *-sb*, which are the same files just without the pleasant beep. You can download this rocket standalone with the *tfdb-notrail-snowball*, which only contains the rocket particle effect. 

That's all, with love from a dodgeball nonamer
