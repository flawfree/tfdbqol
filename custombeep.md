# Changing your beep sound

It's relatively simple to change the rocket beep to your liking. Be aware that this will also change the beep sound the level 1 sentry makes in other gamemodes as well. **This works in combination with both of the -sb editions**.

Create a folder in your *\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom* folder, name this whatever you would like. Inside this folder, create a folder called *sound*, and inside this folder create a folder called *weapons*. Your directory should look like this:

>**\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom\(whatever you named your folder)\sound\weapons**

Inside here, place any **.wav** file, and name it **sentry_spot.wav**, mp3 files will not work. You might have to trial and error with the volume of your .wav to fit it to your liking. Join a DB server, and try it out.

You could either download a .wav file, or programs like *audacity* are a free alternative to convert mp3 to .wav.

This could take some trial and error, but try it out!

## The sound needs to be at a sample rate of either 44100hz, 22050hz or 11025hz.
